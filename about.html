            <h3 class="section-header">Definitions</h3>
            <p class="section-text">
              As a term, "Vocaloid" has a wide range of definitions. The term
              originated as the name of a software developed by Yamaha starting
              in early 2000, which aimed to replicate the sounds of the human
              voice through means of vocal synthesis (which will be explained in
              more detail later). However, the success of the software has seen
              its name take on various other meanings. Not only has "Vocaloid"
              become a blanket term for vocal synthesis engines in general, but
              it has also been used to describe the various avatars of its
              voicebanks, as well as a blended genre of music due to its unique
              sound. The goal of this site is to encompass all facets of what
              defines the term "Vocaloid".

            <h3 class="section-header">Software</h3>
            <p class="section-text">
              As a piece of software, VOCALOID is described as a vocal synthesis
              engine. Its main goal is to replicate the sound and capabilities
              of the human voice to "sing" melodies over music. This is achieved
              by combining synthesizer software, which allows only for pitch and
              effect modulation, with specially recorded sets of vocal samples
              (known as voice banks) that can be used to interpret the lyrics of
              each note. With each new version of VOCALOID, more and more
              options for manipulating these samples to sound realistic are
              added. As an example, the most recent release VOCALOID 6 saw the
              addition of the VOCALOID:AI feature, which uses data gathered from
              deep learning algorithms trained on the performances of human
              singers to replicate more natural vocal expressions, controlling
              aspects such as tone and pitch variation.

            <p class="section-text">
              The software's unique nature and heavy reliance on voice banks led
              to a unique marketing strategy being developed for them. Each
              voice bank is marketed as a "singer in a box" or “virtual idol”,
              complete with an animated character to fit the recorded voice.
              Most artists who use the software also use these characters to
              represent their music, even going so far as to animate the
              characters into their music videos. Additionally, many of the
              characters' names have transcended the artists' likenesses, much
              to the dismay of some creators (most notably the late wowaka, who
              briefly went on a hiatus from creating new Vocaloid music in 2011
              for this reason). However, this marketing strategy has seen great
              success in many great varieties -- more about these successes can
              be found on the "History" page of this site.

            <h3 class="section-header">The Music</h3>
            <p class="section-text">
              Vocaloid has had a very significant impact on the music industry
              thus far. It has allowed people who may not have had the
              opportunity to make music before to create and share their own
              songs. It has also helped to break down barriers between different
              cultures and genres of music. In Japan, Vocaloid music has become
              a major cultural phenomenon. There are now Vocaloid concerts,
              festivals, and even theme parks. Vocaloid music has also been used
              in commercials, anime, and video games. This goes without
              mentioning that many popular Japanese solo artists got their start
              with Vocaloid music. Some good examples are the artists John (now
              known as Tooboe), whose song “Tablet” was recently featured as an
              ending in the anime Chainsaw Man, as well as Eve, whose song
              “Kaikai Kitan” was featured as the Season 1 opening for the anime
              Jujutsu Kaisen.It's just cool.

            <h3 class="section-header">The Events</h3>
            <p class="section-text">
              Vocaloid live events typically feature a holographic model
              vocalist projected onto a screen to make it seem like they are
              there in person. On the stage with them is a live band as well as
              back-up dancers in some cases. The first Vocaloid live concert was
              held in 2004 at the Polyphony Studio 5th Anniversary Concert in
              Novosibirsk, Russia. It featured the Vocaloid Miriam, who
              performed the song "Sad Mondays" with live musicians. The first
              Vocaloid concert in Japan was held in 2009 at Animelo Summer Live,
              where Hatsune Miku performed the songs "Miku Miku ni Shite Ageru"
              by Piano Echoes and "Black★Rock Shooter" by Supercell. Since then,
              there have been many more concerts, both in Japan and around the
              world. Some of the most popular Vocaloid live concerts include the
              Hatsune Miku Expo, the Magical Mirai concert series, and the
              Mikunopolis concert series. Vocaloid live concerts are a popular
              way for fans to experience the music of their favorite Vocaloids.
              They are also a great way to introduce new people to Vocaloid
              music. If you have never been to a Vocaloid live concert, I highly
              recommend checking one out. It is an experience that you will not
              soon forget.

            <p class="section-text">
              The success of Vocaloid lies not only within the software and its
              music, but also in the ever-growing community it has spawned. It
              has influenced various new types of media outside music, such as
              video games, anime/manga, cosplay, and other forms of art.
              Vocaloid has spawned a few rhythm games exclusively in its own
              world, including Project Sekai: COLORFUL STAGE and Hatsune Miku:
              Project DIVA. The music and voicebanks are often featured in other
              video games as well, such as the game Yakuza 5 which contains an
              easter egg that allows your character to wear the costume of
              Hatsune Miku. (Could you tell they like Miku?) Vocaloid has also
              made appearances in animated media as well: in the series Bee &
              Puppycat, the main character Puppycat is voice-acted by Oliver.

            <p class="section-text">
              Being the most user-facing aspect of Vocaloid, the Score Editor is
              where the user inputs the notes and corresponding lyrics they
              would like Vocaloid to sing. This is done by placing the notes
              onto a grid, where the X axis determines the length of the note
              and the Y axis determines the pitch. Each note is also assigned a
              phoneme, or phonetic sound unit – in short, these combine to form
              the words that are sung with the notes.

            <h3 class="section-header">Voice Banks</h3>
            <p class="section-text">
              A voice bank is a database of samples recorded by a live vocal
              artist. This includes samples of the singer pronouncing every
              possible phoneme (phonetic sound unit) in the given language, as
              well as variant combinations of phonemes, to provide full
              pronunciation ability. The singer also usually records each
              phoneme in 3 or 4 different pitches to provide a broad vocal
              range.

              The Synthesis Engine is what drives Vocaloid to sound human. Based
              on the selected note/lyric combinations from the Score Editor,
              this component selects the best samples from the voice bank to
              match the given word or syllable. Once the best sample (or
              combination of samples) have been selected, the engine then
              matches their pitch to the given note. In short, this component is
              responsible for turning the user’s input into sound.
