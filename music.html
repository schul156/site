            Widely regarded as one of the most well-known Vocaloid songs,
            “Rolling Girl” brings out many of the late Wowaka’s best elements in
            song form. The atmosphere sets a very outwardly upbeat tone while
            retaining a deep sadness behind it. This is complemented by the
            lyrics, which detail the story of a girl who struggles to continue
            “rolling” in the face of failure. Alongside its addictive melodies
            and energetic pace, many listeners also find themselves resonating
            with the lyrics, which helped add to this song’s success and
            memorability.

          Patterns, also known as Pretty Patterns Inc., is an up-and-coming
          producer from France who has only recently begun exploring the
          capabilities of vocal synth. While they use the SynthesizerV engine as
          opposed to the Vocaloid engine, “ATARAXIA” is as beautiful of a song
          as it is innovative with the use of vocal synthesis. Utilizing the
          voicebank of Eleanor Forte, Patterns creates an elegant musical
          atmosphere with this song that accompanies their voice perfectly.

          On his debut album “Worlds”, Porter Robinson took EDM in a different
          direction by blending new elements from other genres into his sound to
          create a dreamy, futuristic feel. The song “Sad Machine”, which
          lyrically details the story of a humanoid robot longing for human
          connection, features a duet between Robinson and the voicebank of
          Avanna. The use of Vocaloid, as well as his distinct processing and
          mixing with the other synth elements, greatly add to the overall theme
          and create an ethereal listening experience.

          With the invention of Vocaloid, it was only a matter of time before
          someone out there tried to make it do metal vocals – and thus, Utsu-P
          was born. While Utsu-P is not the only artist to attempt this, he is
          the most well-known and most prolific to do so, with over 14 released
          albums to date and more to come. Being one of his most recent works,
          “Ga” shows Utsu-P’s true capabilities with Vocaloid – his signature
          blend of EDM and metal instrumentations combine perfectly with the
          wide range of modulation and effects now possible through the
          software. The harsh vocals at the end also show great improvement over
          his previous works.

          Hachi is an artist who may have a familiar sound if you’ve seen
          Chainsaw Man. He’s since moved away from working with Vocaloid to
          focus on writing solo music, however his work as Hachi was met with
          wild success. Hachi is often known for writing songs with abstract and
          surreal meanings, and “Matryoshka” is a perfect example of that. The
          song’s lyrics, while very well-constructed, don’t actually mean
          anything – much like a matryoshka doll, whose many layers only contain
          hot air. The music itself carries a chaotic and upbeat feeling,
          accompanied by entrancing melodies.

          Sasakure.UK has been considered a pioneer in the Vocaloid community
          since his debut in early 2007, earning him somewhat of an “underground
          classic” status. The song “Future Eve” shows Sasakure.UK’s incredible
          ability to blend elements of rock and electronic music, as well as
          write deep and thought-provoking lyrics.
